# Titanic-Machine-Learning-Challenge

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

The aim of this project is to analyze what sorts of people were likely to survive.

Packages like numpy, pandas and sklearn have been used extensively. Feature engineering has been done to create new features and drop irrevalent features. Different models such as Naive Bayes, SGD Classifier, Perceptron, LinearSVC, logistic regression, SVM, KNN, XGB Classifier, decision tree and random forest have been used. Random forest outperformed other models. Grid search has been used to tune the parameters of random forest model to further improve the results.
